"""
Simplelogs is a logging system as a service (RESTful API).
It was made using MongoDB and Flask Framework.
Now I'm working on extending methods-list and client libraries.
Now it available for Python and Java. In future I think I will add lib for Objective-C.
Simplelogs is a very tiny layer between MongoDB and HTTP requests.

Fell free to contact with me by e-mail or IM.
