Version: __0.2.3__

About
=====
Simplelogs is [RESTful] [rest] API logging system written in Python. It based on [MongoDB] [mongo] and [Flask Framework] [flask].

For start Simplelogs use:

    python app.py

For testing sending log message you can use [curl].

Requirements
============
  * [MongoDB] [mongo]
  * [Flask Framework] [flask]
  * [PyMongo] [pymongo]
  * [PyYAML] [pyyaml]
  * [Flask-WTF] [Flask-WTF]
  * [Any web-server with WSGI support] [deploying]

Config-file description
=======================
__app/config.yaml__ - configuration file. Config file is in YAML-format.

It has 2 section: _mongo_ and _levels_.

Mongo section describes base information about connection:

  * _host_ - hostname
  * _port_ - connection port
  * _user_ - not yet supported
  * _password_ not yet supported
  * _database_ - which database will be used
  * _collection_ - which collection in _database_ will be used

_Level_ section describes logenty levels. By default it includes:

  * _Critical_ – for errors that lead to termination
  * _Error_ – for errors that occur, but are handled
  * _Warning_ – for exceptional circumstances that might not be errors
  * _Notice_ – for non-error messages you usually want to see
  * _Info_ – for messages you usually don’t want to see
  * _Debug_ – for debug messages
  
You can add, remove or modify any of level you want. You don't need to restart server after it. 

Log entry description
=====================
Log-entry is a collection of 3 required and 2 non-required entries:

  * _level_ (Required) - only text. Shoud be specified in app/config.yaml
  * _datetimestamp_ - current datetime stamp. You don't need to send it. Server will do it automaticly.
  * _owner_ (Required) - text or dict (hash-table, key-value storage). Dict can include arrays. (MAX 7 MB)
  * _data_ (Required) - text or dict (hash-table, key-value storage). Dict can include arrays. (MAX 7 MB)
